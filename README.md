# About This Game

You are a "ProsSpectre" â€“ a prospector who searches the asteroid belt for the rare spectrite. But spectrite is illusive, and often sends back an echo to your ground penetrating radar (GPR) that shows up as additional deposits; these are called spectral positives, and are indistinguishable from the real thing. Using your GPR, and good bit of intuition, your goal is to leave your prospecting site with positive Â¢reds. However, you only get 12 hours to prospect, and each time you use your GPR or do a dig, it costs both Â¢reds and hours. So, if you want to stay in business, use your resources wisely. Good luck, ProsSpectre!
