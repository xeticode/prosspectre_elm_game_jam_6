# ProsSpectre ðŸ‘»

This game was created as part of the [Elm Game Jam 6](https://itch.io/jam/elm-game-jam-6). The theme of the jam was "Illusion". We hope you have fun playing it!

# Introducton

You are a "ProsSpectre" â€“ a prospector who searches the asteroid belt for the rare spectrite. But spectrite is illusive, and often sends back an echo to your ground penetrating radar (GPR) that shows up as additional deposits; these are called spectral positives, and are indistinguishable from the real thing. Using your GPR, and good bit of intuition, your goal is to leave your prospecting site with positive Â¢reds. However, you only get 12 hours to prospect, and each time you use your GPR or do a dig, it costs both Â¢red and time. So, if you want to stay in business, use your resources wisely. Good luck, ProsSpectre!

# How to Play

You start prospecting with 12 hours and 5 Â¢reds. Your goal is to come away with as much Â¢reds as possible, hopefully more than you started with.

You have 2 tools at your disposal:

1. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
2. Digging Rig

## Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)

The GPR has 2 modes: Area and Point. Area GPR has a radius of 2 from center. It reports any possible spectrite deposits it sees within that radius. Some of these deposits are real, and some are spectral positives. Thankfully, your GPR is smart enough to predict the number of real deposits there are in the total, however, it cannot tell you which of the deposits they are. You will need your Point GPR to help you determine that.

Point GPR is a more focused radar, and therefore cannot be fooled by spectral positives, however, it can only report how close it is to the nearest real deposit and not its actual location - spectrite is just too illusive.

Whether you use Area or Point GPR, it costs 1 hour and 1 Â¢red to use it.

## Digging Rig

Using both your Area and Point GPR, you should be able to pinpoint with some certainty where the real spectrite deposits are and use your Digging Rig to extract them. As with GPR, 1 dig costs 1 hour and 1 Â¢red. If you dig in the wrong place, you will come up empty handed, having spent the hour and Â¢red for nothing, so use your intuition and pray for a healthy dose of good fortune when you start digging.

Each time you dig, you either uncover a real spectrite deposit, or you leave an empty hole. Each spectrite deposit is worth 6 Â¢reds, holes are worth nothing. Note that once you dig in a location, you can no longer use GPR there, so be careful where and when you choose to dig.

## Flags

To help you keep track of where you think the real spectrite deposits are, you may set flags on the propsecting map to mark the deposits as spectre or real. This will help you avoid digging in the wrong place. There is no time or Â¢red costs to placing or removing flags.

## Scoring

When you run out of time, you want to have at least ended your prospecting with a positive amount of Â¢reds. However, the more Â¢reds you have, the greater your reputation as a ProsSpectre:

- End with <1 Â¢reds: Bankrupt ProsSpectre - find a new profession
- End with 1-5 Â¢reds: Novice ProsSpectre
- End with 6-10 Â¢reds: Experienced ProsSpectre
- End with 11-15 Â¢reds: Expert ProsSpectre
- End with 16-20 Â¢reds: Master ProsSpectre
- End with 21+ Â¢reds: Legendary ProsSpectre
