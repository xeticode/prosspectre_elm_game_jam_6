{-| Asteroids are usually classified by 3 types:

  - C-type for "chondrite"
  - S-type for "stony"
  - M-type for "metallic"

Since there are over 1 million documented asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, in ProsSpectre, we assume that they are broken up into series of no more than 99,999 asteroids each, starting at A and going to Z, then AA to ZZ, etc.

Thus an asteroid with the designation FM01279 would be the the 1,279th asteroid in the F series, and would be metallic in nature.

Each asteroid is divided up into 1 more more mining sectors which are then purchased by ProsPectres for mining.
